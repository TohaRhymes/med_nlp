20006					Interpolated Year when cancer first diagnosed	This is the interpolated time when the participant indicated the corresponding cancer was first diagnosed by a doctor, measured in years.    If the participant gave a calendar year, then the best-fit time is half-way through that year. For example if the year was given as 1970, then the value presented is 1970.5   If the participant gave their age then the value presented is the fractional year corresponding to the mid-point of that age. For example, if the participant said they were 30 years old then the value is the date at which they were 30years+6months.  Interpolated values before the date of birth were truncated forwards to that time.   Interpolated values after the time of data acquisition were truncated back to that time.
20007					Interpolated Age of participant when cancer first diagnosed	This is the interpolated time when the participant indicated the corresponding cancer was first diagnosed by a doctor, given as their estimated age.    If the participant gave a calendar year, then the best-fit time is their age at the mid-point of that year.

This question was dropped from the touchscreen protocol on 24/10/2016.
20023					Mean time to correctly identify matches	"This field is the mean duration to first press of snap-button summed over rounds in which both cards matched. It gives a crude measure of the raw processing+reaction speed of a participant.   The following data points were excluded when forming the average:   Rounds 0-4 were regarded as ""training"";   Times under 50ms must be due to anticipation rather than reaction;   Times over 2000ms were ignored as the cards had disappeared by then.     Values were rounded to the nearest whole number."
20074					Home location at assessment - east co-ordinate (rounded)	This location information is based on the postcode for the address to which the participants invitation was sent. If the participant updated their home address during their assessment centre visit, then that postcode was used as the source instead.   The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre. This East co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the North co-ordinate in ~F20075~.   For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. Research proposals that require location details to a finer level of granularity (i.e. 100m) should request ~F20033~ and ~F20034~, however special approval will be required to release the more detailed information.
20075					Home location at assessment - north co-ordinate (rounded)	This location information is based on the postcode for the address to which the participants invitation was sent. If the participant updated their home address during their assessment centre visit, then that postcode was used as the source instead.   The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre. This North co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the East co-ordinate in ~F20074~.   For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. Research proposals that require location details to a finer level of granularity (i.e. 100m) should request ~F20033~ and ~F20034~, however special approval will be required to release the more detailed information.
20077					Number of diet questionnaires completed	
20081					Hour-of-day questionnaire completed	This is the hour at which the diet questionnaire was completed. It is represented using the standard 24-hour clock whereby (e.g.) 14 represents the interval 2.00pm to 2.59pm inclusive.
20082					Duration of questionnaire	This is the time participants took to complete the diet questionnaire as measured from initially connecting to the web-server to clicking the sign-off button on the final screen. Participants were able to stop and resume completing a questionnaire multiple times within the same day, and hence the longer times recorded are unlikely to indicate continuous use.

Are you often troubled by feelings of guilt?   Participants could answer Yes, No, Do not know or Prefer not to answer.   This field summarises the number of Yes answers across these twelve questions into a single integer score for each participant.   This derived data field has come from Professor Jill Pell from the Institute of Health &amp; Wellbeing, University of Glasgow. Methods on how these fields were derived can be found in the Additional Resources tab.

22702					Home location - east co-ordinate (rounded)	This location information is based on the postcode for an address at which the participant is believed to have been resident, derived from a number of sources.   The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre. This East co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the North co-ordinate in ~F22704~.   For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. Research proposals that require location details to a finer level of granularity (i.e. 100m) should request ~F22701~ and ~F22703~, however special approval will be required to release the more detailed information.   In some cases participants will appear to be at the same location at consecutive times. This occurs because there is a difference of under 1Km in the distance between two consecutive locations according to the more granular data.
