This README is a description of the heritability manifest corresponding to the Pan-UK Biobank Project,,
"For a description of the project and details of the analysis, please see https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/",,
The code used to generate the GWAS summary statistics is publicly available here: https://github.com/atgu/ukbb_pan_ancestry,,
"For information about summary statistics files, see: https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/docs/per-phenotype-files#per-phenotype-files",,
Note: this manifest was created on 23-03-01.,,

Notes about fields in the manifest:,,
heritability is an array of structs which holds one element per heritability.pop.,,
heritability.estimates contain all heritability point estimates.,,
heritability.qcflags contains QC data as described below.,,
Heritability methods: this field type refers to fields within the heritability.estimates struct which organize estimates from each tested heritability method.,,
"Heritability estimates: this field type refers to fields present in some (or all) of each heritability method struct. The intercept and ratio are only reported for LD score regression, while h2_liability, h2_observed, h2_z are present for all methods except Saige.",,
Heritability estimates: saige only reports a pseudoheritability estimate which is reported in heritbability.estimates.saige.,,
,,
Field type,Field,Descriptor
Phenotype ID,trait_type,"One of the following: continuous, biomarkers, prescriptions, icd10, phecode, categorical"
Phenotype ID,phenocode,"The code for the phenotype (for continuous, biomarkers, and categorical traits, this corresponds to the field ID as described by UKB, e.g. 21001 for BMI)"
Phenotype ID,pheno_sex,"Indicating whether the phenotype was run for both sexes (pheno_sex=""both_sexes"") or in just females (pheno_sex=""females"") or males (pheno_sex=""males""). In 0.1, this is only differentiated for phecodes"
Phenotype ID,coding,"For categorical variables, this corresponds to the coding that was used (e.g. coding 2 for field 1747). For all other trait_types, this field is blank"
Phenotype ID,modifier,"Refers to any miscellaneous downstream modifications of the phenotype (e.g. irnt for inverse-rank normal transformation). If the phenotype is updated, this field can be used to denote the update (e.g. the particular wave of COVID-19 data used)."
